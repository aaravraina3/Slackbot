Goal in Generate: Someone who is Generate to build a community and to find friends. A little more laid back in the professional development aspect but still wants to grow and improve.

Shared Interests: Someone who has similar interests as me but can also introduce me to things I haven't explored yet. So a mix and new and familiar.

Relationship Style: I'd like a peer to peer relationship where we can learn from each other. Someone who is approachable and enjoys helping others. Age doesn't matter to me.

Social Goals: Someone who likes to meet new people and is interested in going to all the cool Generate events. It's always easier to go to things when you know someone who's going.

These feel pretty specific but I'm open to meeting anyone who is looking to meet others as well.","I like to:
- play guitar
- play and watch sports mainly basketball and mma
- read nonfiction
- movies/tv shows. honestly anything that is art related I will be interested.
- fashion. I'm always trying to find new styles, my closet has gotten pretty boring recently.
- all kinds of music but someone whose a jazz head would be ideal. I just started learning jazz guitar so someone who can put me on would be fantastic.
- I'm a big fan of parks and green spaces.The Arnold Arboretum is one of the coolest places in Boston.
- I never really been a huge fan of nightlife stuff but I've been wanting to try it out
- I like to workout and go to the gym","It hard to say but I would love to meet someone who becomes a solid friend inside and outside of Generate. Someone who can show me a new perspective and is interested in trying new things.

Honestly this is a very cool idea and I'm excited to see how it pans out.",None,,selvaraju.v@northeastern.edu;

Also, I love going to the movie theaters or even something like going to a cafe to yap and study. I LOVE playing tennis and pickleball so that could be really fun. I also love video games and have a pc in my dorm (I also go to the PC cafe). My favorite games are Overwatch, Fortnite, Gang Beasts, and Overcooked (off the top of my head, but I'm really not picky... except Valorant (no hate I'm just SO bad)).","I really hope to find someone who I enjoy hanging out with (whether that be relaxing/studying in Snell or going out to eat or play tennis/pickleball with).
