# Generate Feedback Bot - Changelog

## Current Status: WORKING ✅
- Bot can send DMs successfully
- Google Sheets integration working
- Message templates updated
- Tracking sheets created
- Code pushed to GitHub (secrets removed for security)

## Issues & Solutions

### 1. Email Lookup Problems ❌
**Issue:** Some people can't be found in Slack by email
- People might use different emails in Slack vs roster
- **IMPORTANT:** Some people use `@husky.neu.edu` emails in Slack instead of `@northeastern.edu`

**Examples Found:**
- Chelsea Kwan: Uses `kwan.che@husky.neu.edu` in Slack (not `kwan.che@northeastern.edu`)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- [x] Add fallback email lookup (try Northeastern + husky variations)
- [x] Try email variations: `@northeastern.edu`, `@husky.neu.edu`

**Solutions Still Needed:**
- [ ] Add manual Slack username mapping
- [ ] Create error handling for missing users
- [ ] Add logging for failed lookups
- [ ] Try personal email variations

### 2. Reaction Tracking Not Working ❌
**Issue:** Bot can't track reactions to messages
**Current Status:** Need additional Slack scopes

**Required Scopes:**
- `reactions:read` - Read reactions on messages
- `channels:history` - Read message history  
- `im:history` - Read DM history

**Alternative Solutions:**
- [ ] Ask people to reply "DONE" instead of react
- [ ] Check Google Form responses directly
- [ ] Use keyword detection in replies

### 3. Form Completion Tracking ❌
**Issue:** Bot can't properly check if forms are completed
**Current Status:** Need to implement form response checking

**Solutions Needed:**
- [ ] Connect to Google Forms API to check responses
- [ ] Match form responses to Slack users
- [ ] Update tracking sheets when forms are completed
- [ ] Handle different response formats

### 4. Form Preview Not Showing ❌
**Issue:** Google Form not showing as embedded preview in Slack
**Status:** Partially fixed - URL on separate line
**Still needs:** Verification that previews work consistently

### 5. Message Template Updates ✅
**Changes Made:**
- Changed "team" to "Community team" 
- Updated cooldown from "4 weeks" to "until your whole team has done it"
- Added "React to this message after you're done so the bot can check you off"

## Technical Issues Fixed ✅

### SSL Certificate Error
**Problem:** `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`
**Solution:** Added SSL context that disables certificate verification

### Google Sheets Permissions
**Problem:** `HttpError 403` - Permission denied
**Solution:** Shared sheet with service account as Editor

### Missing Sheets
**Problem:** `HttpError 400` - Unable to parse range
**Solution:** Created missing "Roster", "Tracking", "Reached Out", "Responded" sheets

### Module Import Errors
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bot'`
**Solution:** Used `python -m scripts.script_name` and proper PYTHONPATH

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Change Generate Slackbot PFP** - Update bot profile picture
2. **Fix checking if form is done** - Implement proper form completion tracking
3. **Fix email lookup** - Add fallback mechanisms  
4. **Implement reaction tracking** - Add required scopes or alternative method
5. **Test with more people** - Verify bot works with different users

### Medium Priority  
1. **Add error logging** - Track failed lookups and sends
2. **Create admin dashboard** - View who was contacted and who responded
3. **Add retry logic** - Handle temporary failures

### Low Priority
1. **Optimize message formatting** - Ensure consistent form previews
2. **Add analytics** - Track response rates by team
3. **Create backup systems** - Handle API failures gracefully
